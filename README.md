### Poland

President Andrzej Duda, 6 April 2022:

> “It is hard to deny this, of course. This is a crime which fulfills
> the features of a genocide, especially if you look at the context
> of different conversations that are being conducted. [...]
> The fact that civilian inhabitants of Ukraine are being killed shows
> best what the goal of [the] Russian invasion is.  The goal of that
> invasion is simply to extinguish the Ukrainian nation.”

_(It should be noted that the USA's position on war crimes would be much stronger_
_if it were itself a signatory to the International Criminal Court, but it is not;_
_it is one of three countries that [never ratified the Rome Statute](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61021862)._
_The other two are Russia and China.)_

### Canada

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, 13 April 2022:

> “There are official processes around determinations of genocide, but I think it's
> absolutely right that more people be talking and using the word genocide in terms
> of what Russia is doing, what Vladimir Putin has done [...] These are all things
> that are war crimes that Putin is responsible for, these are all things that are
> crimes against humanity.”
